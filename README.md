Live distribution focusing on Tiling WM's (currently XMonad, Subtle, and DWM)

This is a code overhaul using a more robust build system after the demise of the 'larch' build scripts

--------------------------
This is a highly customized version of XMonad, running both dzen2 (with multiple patches) and conky-cli.  This setup is mostly designed around the use of the console, with only 2 possible layouts: ResizableTiled and Full.  ResizableTiled is what I use the most, as it provides lots of flexibility in both layout and in resizing.  

dwm is vanilla at this point.

subtle is vanilla at this point.

When the system boots up, you will be brought to a normal console login and automatically logged into the system.

Please change your p/w's once you boot into the system!
